# 🤖 Week 2 — Model Training: Objectives and Overview

> **Goal:** Develop and refine a machine learning model using reproducible, version-controlled, and automated practices aligned with MLOps Level 2 maturity.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, participants will:
- Understand the **MLOps training step** and its role in the end-to-end ML lifecycle.  
- Prepare and **version training data** to ensure reproducibility and traceability.  
- Perform **feature engineering** and document transformations for consistency across environments.  
- Conduct **model experimentation**, comparing algorithms and configurations systematically.  
- Apply **hyperparameter tuning** and track results with experiment tracking tools (e.g., MLflow).  
- Validate and select models based on **performance metrics** and **business relevance**.

## ⚙️ The MLOps Training Step

The **MLOps training step** is the process of developing and refining a machine learning model using data and algorithms in a **controlled, reproducible, and automated way**.

It bridges **data preparation** and **model deployment**, ensuring that the model you train can be reliably reproduced, validated, and deployed through CI/CD workflows.

This phase typically includes:
1. Preparing and versioning datasets.  
2. Experimenting with models and hyperparameters.  
3. Tracking all experiments, metadata, and results.  
4. Validating model performance.  
5. Promoting the best model to the deployment stage.

## 🔑 Key Activities in the Model Training Step

### 1️⃣ Data Preparation and Feature Engineering
- Clean, preprocess, and transform raw data into a **training-ready format**.  
- Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.  
- Create and document **engineered features** that improve model learning.  
- Store and version both the **transformation code** and **processed datasets** for reproducibility.

> ✅ *Outcome:* A reproducible dataset and feature set ready for model training.

---

### 2️⃣ Model Selection
- Choose the most appropriate **machine learning algorithm** for the problem type:  
  - **Supervised Learning:** Classification, regression  
  - **Unsupervised Learning:** Clustering, dimensionality reduction  
  - **Reinforcement Learning:** Sequential decision-making  
- Justify model selection based on data characteristics, business objectives, and interpretability needs.

> ✅ *Outcome:* A shortlist of candidate models suitable for experimentation.

---

### 3️⃣ Experimentation and Hyperparameter Tuning
- Train models using different **hyperparameter configurations** (e.g., learning rate, tree depth).  
- Use **experiment tracking** (e.g., MLflow, SageMaker Experiments) to log:  
  - Model parameters and metrics  
  - Training duration and hardware configuration  
  - Data version and code commit hash  
- Compare runs and visualize performance metrics to identify the best configuration.  
- Document performance trade-offs (accuracy, latency, cost, interpretability).

> ✅ *Outcome:* A reproducible record of experiments and a validated model candidate.

---

## 📦 Expected Outputs
By the end of this week, participants should produce:
- A **training script or notebook** (e.g., `train_model.py` or `training_pipeline.ipynb`)  
- **Logged experiments** with parameters, metrics, and artifacts (via MLflow or SageMaker)  
- A **trained model artifact** (e.g., `.pkl` or `.onnx`) stored in version control or a registry  
- A **model evaluation report** summarizing metrics and chosen model rationale  

---

## 🔁 MLOps Integration

Training is not a one-time process — it’s part of a **continuous cycle**:
- Automated retraining is triggered by **new data** or **drift detection**.  
- All experiments are **tracked and versioned**, ensuring reproducibility.  
- The **best-performing model** is seamlessly promoted to deployment pipelines.  

This step ensures that models evolve reliably and remain aligned with changing data and business conditions.

> **Next Step → Deployment**  
> Once a model is validated and versioned, the next stage focuses on **deploying** it in a scalable, monitored production environment using CI/CD automation.
